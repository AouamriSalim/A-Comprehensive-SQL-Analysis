This Advanced SQL query is a comprehensive data retrieval and aggregation operation involving multiple tables. The first part utilizes a LEFT JOIN between the Pointage and sous_famille tables, calculating the sum of certain values for distinct categories (cat) and dates in the year 2022. A UNION is employed to include categories with no corresponding records in the Pointage table and the final result is ordered by category and date.

The second part extends the query to include monthly aggregations for the year 2022. It involves a subquery that calculates monthly sums, considering conditions from the regul table. The results are then pivoted to transform the data into a structured format with categories and monthly columns. The output is ordered by category.

In essence, this query provides a detailed analysis of financial data, presenting both date-specific and month-specific aggregated values for distinct categories from the specified tables.

In summary, the entire query is designed to extract and aggregate data from the Pointage, sous_famille, and regul tables, presenting the results in a structured format that includes both date-based and month-based aggregations, all organized by category (cat).
